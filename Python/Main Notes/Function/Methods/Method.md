## Notes:

Python provides a wide array of built-in methods that are widely used in different types of programming tasks. These methods are grouped based on the data types they work with, such as strings, lists, dictionaries, sets, and more.

### [[String Methods]]
* These methods help manipulate and process strings.

### [[List Methods]]
* Lists are mutable, and these methods allow modification and manipulation.

### [[Dictionary Methods]]
* Dictionaries store key-value pairs. These methods help in accessing and modifying them.

### [[Set Methods]]
* Sets are unordered collections of unique items

### [[File Methods]]
* File methods allow interaction with files

### [[Math and Number Methods]]
* For mathematical operations, Python has built-in methods and math module

## Best Practices for Methods

1. **Use Built-in Methods When Possible**: They are optimized and reliable
2. **Combine Methods for Efficiency**: For example, use .strip() and .lower() together for string normalization.
3. **Avoid Overcomplicating**: Donâ€™t use complex methods where simple loops or logic suffice.
